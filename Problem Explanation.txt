Little Lemon is a popular restaurant that currently lacks an online reserve-a-table feature. This means that customers who want to book a table at the restaurant must do so by calling or visiting the restaurant in person. This can be inconvenient for customers who prefer to make reservations online, and it can also result in missed opportunities for the restaurant. By designing and implementing an online reserve-a-table feature, Little Lemon can provide a more convenient and efficient reservation experience for its customers, while also increasing its potential for bookings.
